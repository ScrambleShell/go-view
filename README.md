go-view
=======

Go-View is an experimental project to build a rudimentary GUI library for Go upon a Cairo backend.  It is being built out in the open for anybody to use, but it is a personal project and should be viewed as such.  I am exploring tangential issues surrounding UI and UX design.  Below, I have placed a few screenshots to give a sense of the asthetic.
