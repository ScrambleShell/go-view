Project Darkhorse

Project Darkhorse is a native graphical library built on top of Cairo in Go.  The purpose of this library is to create
a library of reusable components from which native applications can be built primarily for UNIX like systems.  It is 
not intended to support cross platform development and in its initial incarnation relies on xlib.
